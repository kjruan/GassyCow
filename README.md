# GassyCow

This was a IOS SpriteKit project developed with a very good friend and co-worker DGEIB. 
It's been rejected by Apple due to the farting content =)

However, it serves a pretty good exercise in using SpriteKit and Xcode game project management. 

Feel free to fork and tweak it anyway you like!

Thank you for the support,

Kevin
